Me and my team are especially proud of founding this digital health startup. It's an AI-powered platform that supports women through menopause. We developed and integrated a Langchain-based RAG pipeline using Python, FastAPI, and natural language processing techniques. Beyond leading the technical architecture and developing the platform with Python and FastAPI, this project gave me a firsthand lesson in the unique challenges of healthcare. It taught me that building a solution requires more than just technical skill. It demands a deep focus on data privacy, user trust, and ethical responsibility to address the sensitive needs of users.

- Upgraded menoVa to multi-agent LangGraph architecture with state-based routing that classifies queries to specialized
AI-agents tracks symptom patterns longitudinally per user, and flags urgent cases across 350+ daily conversations,
enabling personalized health insights beyond traditional RAG capabilities.
- Built Python microservices with RAG pipeline (FastAPI, ChromaDB, LangChain, Gemini, AWS EC2) and React/TypeScript
chat interface enabling conversational symptom logging with real-time analytics dashboard for pattern detection.
