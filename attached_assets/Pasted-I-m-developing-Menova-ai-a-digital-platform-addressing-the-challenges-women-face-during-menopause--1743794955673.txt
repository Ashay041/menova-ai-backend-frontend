I'm developing Menova.ai, a digital platform addressing the challenges women face during menopause. As a product manager at a health tech startup, I'm leading this project based on extensive user research that identified significant gaps in menopause care.
Our survey of women (predominantly in perimenopause ~56%) revealed these key pain points:
* Medical professionals dismissing symptoms as "just aging"
* Lack of reliable information about menopause stages and symptoms
* Difficulty tracking symptoms and identifying patterns/triggers
* Feeling isolated without peer support
* No comprehensive digital solution for menopause management
I've designed wireframes for both web and mobile platforms with these core features:
1. AI Chatbot: Provides personalized guidance using verified medical information. The reasoning behind this feature is to give women 24/7 access to reliable information when medical professionals are dismissive or unavailable.
2. Symptom Tracker: Allows users to log symptoms, track patterns, and receive AI insights about potential triggers. This addresses the user need to understand connections between lifestyle choices and symptom severity.
3. Community Forums: Creates safe spaces for women to connect with others in similar stages. We structured this by menopause stage (peri/meno/post) to ensure relevant peer support.
4. Personalized Wellness Plans: Delivers customized recommendations based on symptom patterns. This feature exists because women reported wanting holistic approaches to manage symptoms.
Our brand identity uses:
* Primary color: 
#F26158 (coral/red) - Representing warmth and energy
* Secondary: 
#FFE18B (yellow) - Symbolizing optimism and clarity
* Background accents: 
#FFD7D0 (light pink) - Creating a soft, approachable feeling
* Tertiary: 
#CBE2EA (light blue) - Adding calm and trust elements
I'd like help with [specific next step - e.g., refining user onboarding flow, expanding the AI chatbot capabilities, designing the symptom correlation algorithm logic, etc.]
My specific challenges include [e.g., balancing simplicity with comprehensive tracking, ensuring medical accuracy while being supportive, strategizing user retention, etc.]
This prompt provides detailed context about:
